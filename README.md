###Sports Predictions
This full stack app that consists of a Rails backend with a React/Redux Client side front end that allows you to post predictions on various sporting events before they are determined.

Some crazy ideas will be proven right and will be gloriously remembered; others will be proven hilariously wrong and those predictions will be a source of bonding in the sport fan community for years to come.
